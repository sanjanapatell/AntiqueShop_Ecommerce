        <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1816, Inventor: Rene Laennec
          
When medical practitioners needed to check the heartbeat of patients, they were only limited to placing their ears carefully on a patient’s heart.

There was no means of auscultation, and the old medium always does not yield the desired results.

In 1816, a man named Rene Laennec thought of how to listen carefully to the sounds in the chest.

He couldn’t use the usual method to examine his fat patient.

He started by rolling a sheet of paper into a tube shape, placing each end on the patient’s heart and ear.

The sheet of paper was later replaced with a hollow tube made from wood over the years. The wooden tube was changed, and improvements were made to this invention.

Rene named his device the Stethoscope.">1.Stethoscope</li>
        
        <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1829, Inventor: W. A Burt
          
The first generation of the typewriter was invented in 1829; at that time, there were no other means by which people could write letters, or document anything other than writing.

A typewriter is a manual machine with keyboards, used for typing out data.

An American inventor named William Burt was the first to patent the typewriter. From the start of the 1850s, the typewriter became very useful in offices and media houses.

It would later be improved by contributions like Samuel Soule, Carlos Glidden, and Christopher Sholes.

They were the principal contributors to the booming success of the invention, after developing varieties of typewriter.">2.Typewriter</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1830, Inventor: Barthelemy Thimonnier
           
The period of revolution was still on in France, in the year 1830. In a city located in the south of Paris lived a tailor.

He was popularly known as Bart. He developed the first mechanical tool known as the sewing machine.

The machine at the time was a hooked tambour needle operated in a chain stitch form.

It was later rejected, and Bart’s workshop was destroyed after he began executing large contracts for the military.

Usually, local tailors at that time made money from stitching with bare hands; the only crude means they had to settle for.

The fear of losing their jobs to the mechanical machine made them hate Bart’s invention. This was the first type of sewing machine ever designed.">3.Sewing Machine</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1839, Inventor: Kirkpatrick Macmillan
           
Before the introduction of wheel machines, there were no mechanical means of moving around or traveling.

Kirkpatrick Macmillan completed the invention of the first pedal bicycle. The idea behind his design was a hobbyhorse he admired.

He was brought up in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and served as a blacksmith apprentice under his father. He acquired a few skills that allowed him to build a stable bicycle.

After successfully riding through 14 miles in one hour, he wasn’t ready to patent the first pedal bicycle for business purposes.

Other pedal bicycles made after this first design helped unleashed the potential of the bike as a means of transport.">4.Bicycle</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of invention: 1834, Inventor: Samuel Morse
           
The first telegraph was built by Samuel Morse, an invention that would later be worked on by other inventors.

Morse was born in 1791 and was 43 years when he created the first telegraph.

During the industrial revolution era, there was a need to access long-distance messages.

The telegraph was the first machine to transmit signals over to stations through a wired connection.

Morse is an American, and his first telegraph was sent from Washington D.C. to Maryland.

The telegraph had been accepted across Europe, in the year 1866, telegraph lines were laid across the Atlantic connecting Europe.

Recently, the availability of the internet, fax machine, and telephone have limited telegraph usage.">5.Telegraph</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of invention: 1852, Inventor: Leon Foucault
           
Leon Foucault was a French Physicist born in 1819.

He was the first to patent the gyroscope, a design that could tell the plane of the earth’s rotation depending on its location’s latitude.

He was born in 1819, and in 1852, he invented the first known gyroscope.

It took him some time, but his approach was clear; he made a gyroscope out of a swinging rotating ball with a weighty rim.

The period of rotation was dependent on the latitude of the location. The technique behind the investigation was almost not easy to prove as frictional forces slowed down the spinning system.

This idea is common among kids with a toy gyroscope.">6.Gyroscope</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1887, Inventor: Emile Berliner
           
Emile Berliner wasn’t an American, as some people think. He moved from his country Germany to Washington D.C.

Long before the music started recording on a disc, there was no means of having a personal music player to play your best songs repeatedly.

Emile made a stop to recording on cylinders in 1887, the year he also patented it. He made songs on discs and complemented them with a gramophone for playing the disc.

A needle-like object attached to the arm of the gramophone transmitted the sounds and vibrations to the gramophone.

His gramophone gained more fame after he created a company and convinced artists to record with his systems.">7.Gramophone</li>
        
         <li id="product" class="first-three-furn" title="Date of Invention: 1876, Inventor: Alexander Graham Bell
           
One of the most remarkable inventions that changed the world and aided smooth communication between people.

Graham Bell was born in Scotland but became an American later in his life. He is the first scientist to receive a patent for inventing the telephone.

Despite his countless inventions, Bell loved to be regarded as a teacher of the deaf. He was born in 1847 to a teacher and an impaired organist mother.

Growing up, he didn’t see himself as a bright student but had a talent for solving problems.

He once made a husk remover for his friend’s dad, who works on a wheat farm.">8.Telephone</li>
